# SkipList
Built a custome SkipList for the final proejct in CS 5040.
Skip lists are a data structure that can be used in place of balanced trees. 
Skip lists use probabilistic balancing rather than strictly enforced balancing. 
As a result the algorithms for insertion and deletion in skip lists are much simpler and significantly faster than equivalent algorithms for balanced trees.
